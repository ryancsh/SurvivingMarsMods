# Birth Control

   Having too many homeless colonists?<br>
   Tired of having kids end up in adult residences?<br>
   Tired of micro-managing birth rates?<br>

   This might be the mod for you.

   This behaves very similarly to *Choggi's Nursery Limit Birthing to Spots* mod.<br>
   The difference is that it also limits births based on available adult housing so you don't end up with tons of homeless people if your colony has very high birth rates.

## Features

- **Limit birth rate to nursery slots**

   This mod will intercept all births and instead force the child to spawn in a dome with a nursery instead.<br>
   Once all nurseries fill up, births are blocked until more nursery slots open up.<br>
   No more children in adult residences.

- **Prevent Overpopulation:**

   You can additionally limit births by empty adult housing.<br>
   This option will block births if a child would not have an adult residence once they grow up.<br>
   No more hundreds of homeless people across your colony when your birth rate is too high.

- **Decide between global birth control or per dome birth control**

   - *Global birth control:*
      Intercepted children can be relocated to any dome with space available.<br>
      This is slower performance-wise but makes sure you don't skip any births.

   - *Per Dome control:*
      Intercepted children can spawn in only the dome it would usually spawn in.<br>
      This is faster performance wise, but will block births if the dome does not have enough nursery space.<br>
      Basically, any dome with no nursery in it will produce no children.

- **Early game option available**

   You can decide if all births should be blocked in case you have no nurseries,<br>
   or if the game should use default birth control mechanics when there are no nurseries.


## Caution

- **Per Dome control is not recommended.**

   It's there mainly for performance reasons if you have way too many domes.<br>
   If you use Per Dome control, you need to make sure that you have enough nurseries in each dome, otherwise, children that would normally spawn in that dome won't when that dome's nurseries are full.

- **Not tested with Below and Beyond DLC**

   I don't have the DLC so I have no idea if it behaves properly or not with Below and Beyond.<br>
   If there are issues, try filing a bug report and I'll see what I can do.

- **Disable or avoid using with other birth control mods**

   It's sort of your problem what happens if you enable multiple birth control mods at the same time.<br>
   Pick one, and only one of them to use.
