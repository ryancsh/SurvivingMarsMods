# Mods for Surviving Mars

You may need this mod for other mods to work:

- [Library](https://github.com/ryancsh/SurvivingMarsMods/tree/main/Library): May need this for other mods. *Library* provides utilities that I use so I don't rewrite the same stuff over and over again for different mods.

List of my mods:

- [Birth Control](https://github.com/ryancsh/SurvivingMarsMods/tree/main/Birth%20Control): Automatically control births so that you don't end up with too many colonists when you don't have the housing or resources to support them.
- [Drone Control](https://github.com/ryancsh/SurvivingMarsMods/tree/main/Drone%20Control): Automatically adjust the number of drones at each hub without needing to think about it.
- [QoL Stuff](https://github.com/ryancsh/SurvivingMarsMods/tree/main/QoL%20Stuff): Quality-of-life modifications to the game that aren't substantial enough code for me to feel like I should split them into different mods.
