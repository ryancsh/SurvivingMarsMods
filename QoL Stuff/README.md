# QoL Stuff

   Collection of useful modifications to the game that aren't substantial enough code to warrant getting their own mod.

## Features

- **Global Mod Toggle**

   - Related mod options:
      - *Enable Mod*: Set Off to disable this entire mod and all its features.

- **Drone Idle Recharge**

   - By default, drones only go recharge when they are below 25% battery level, even if they have nothing to do.\
   This mod makes it so that drones that have nothing to do go recharge their battery levels instead.

   - Related mod options:
      - *Drones go recharge when idle* : Set On to enable Drone Idle Recharge.
      - *Drone Recharge Idle Threshold* : If below this level, drones won't go recharge even if above mod setting is on.
